## This Stream
First experiment around new Squire streams (http://www.squireapp.com). Download zip file, uncompress and double-clicking stm file. That's easy!

## Installation
Download or clone this repository and double click on the .stm file (template.stm on this case). The stream will be added automatically to Squire Helper. After a few seconds, the stream’s content will be available on “Movies” section on Squire.app.

## Recommendations
I do recommend to sort Movies by Popular filter. To do this open Squire.app and press down key to access filter list.

## Support
If you are experiencing problems please open a new Issue, so I can take a look.
